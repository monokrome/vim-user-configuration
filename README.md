This is part of my Vim configuration, which uses Vundle. If you
are interested in using this - please install pathogen by following
the documentation [here](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

After installing Vundle, you can just add the following to your
vimrc in order to get started using my configuration:

    Bundle 'monokrome/vim-user-configuration'
    
Inside Vim, run `:BundleInstall` to install it - and then restart
Vim. You're done.

If you are interested in seeing an example of how this works, here
is [my vimrc](https://raw.github.com/monokrome/vim-config/master/vimrc).
