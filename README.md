This is part of my Vim configuration, which uses Plug. If you are interested in
using this - please install Plug by following [the documentation here](vplg).

After installing Vundle, you can jadd the following to your vimrc in order to
get started using my configuration:

    Plug 'monokrome/vim-user-configuration'
    
Inside Vim, run `:PlugInstall` to install it - and then restart Vim. You're
done.

If you are interested in seeing an example of how this works, here is
[my vimrc][vrc].
